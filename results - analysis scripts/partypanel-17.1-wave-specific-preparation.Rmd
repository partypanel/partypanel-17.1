### Lottery (if there is one)
########################################################################

### The lottery works by setting the minimum and maximum ID of the
### entries for this wave in the incentives table of the database. These
### are the IDs eligible for winning a prize.
###
### We then create a vector of the prizes.
###
### Then, we select as many random IDs from the 'elegibility vector' as
### we have prizes in the 'prizes vector'. This list is then sorted
### ascendingly (i.e. from low to high).
###
### We then generate the MySQL query required to retrieve the
### email addresses corresponding to these IDs.
###
### These email addresses are then combined with the prizes to generate
### a complete list. This final list is then sent to the Celebrate Safe
### project executives for further handling. Note that these last steps
### are not stored in this file to protect the participants' privacy.

### We first set the seed, which is always the starting date of the
### Party Panel wave as YYYYMMDD.
set.seed(20170420);

### IDs of 17.1 entries in incentives table
eligibleIDs <- 425:690;

### For wave 17.1, we have 1 set of Earproof Performer earplugs,
### 4 sets of Earproof Platinum or Silver earplugs, and 5
### Thunderplugs blisterpacks.
prizes <- c(rep("Earproof Performer", 1),
            rep("Earproof Platinum/Silver", 4),
            rep("Thunderplugs", 5));

### Select 10 IDs
winners <- sample(eligibleIDs, 10);

### Sort IDs ascendingly
winners <- sort(winners);

### Match winners to prizes
winnersMatchedToPrizes <- cbind(winners, prizes);

### Generate MySQL query to retrieve email addresses for each ID
mySqlQuery <-
  paste0("SELECT * FROM `pp_incentives` WHERE `id` IN (",
         paste0(winners, collapse=", "), ");");

### Show the query to run it using HeidiSQL or another MySQL interface
#cat(mySqlQuery);

### (The following lines should usually cause an error, because the
###  personal data (each winner's email address) should never be
###  stored in this file. Therefore, this is run using tryCatch to
###  catch that error.)
tryCatch({
  
### Then, using HeidiSQL or another MySQL interface, run the
### query and export the results. In HeidiSQL, this can be done
### by rightclicking the list of results and selecting
### "Export grid rows". Make sure to select "Copy to clipboard" as
### the "Output target", "Delimited text" as "Output format", and
### "Complete" as "Row selection". The other settings can remain at
### their defaults (column names in first row; comma as field
### separator, duoble quotes as encloser, and carriage return and
### newline symbols for line termination).
### Then, paste the results between the two single quotes
### on the following lines:
winnerData <- read.csv(text =
'

'
);
### IMPORTANT: once the final list has been generated, remove
### these data again to protect the participants' privacy!!!

### Add the vector with prizes to this data frame (check 
winnerData <- cbind(winnerData, prizes);

### Show the final list
#print(winnerData);

}, error = function(e) {
  ### No lottery data entered.
  invisible(NULL);
}); ### Close tryCatch

### Description of this wave
waveSpecificDescription <- "It was developed to explore the determinants of protecting one's ears when exposed to loud music in nightlife settings. Specifically, three behaviors were explored: carrying hearing protection, wearing hearing protection, and buying hearing protection if one did not carry but was exposed to loud music.";

### Statement about the random numbers that were assigned
waveSpecificRandomNumberStatement <- "Participants received two random numbers, the first between (and including) 1 and 3, and the second between (and including) 1 and 4. The first random number was used to determine about which behavior participants received questions. If it was 1, participants received questions about carrying hearing protection; if 2, about wearing hearing protection; and if 3, about buying hearing protection. Participants were told which behavior would be presented to them, and they were able to indicate that they wanted to answer questions about multiple behaviors.

The second random number was not used in this wave. (It was left in the questionnaire as the LimeSurvey questionnaires for new Party Panel waves are copied from the most recent preceding wave, and since two random numbers are often used, it was deemed convenient to simply leave this question in.)";
